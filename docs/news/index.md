# Changelog

## multiscape 1.2.1

### Spatial relations

- [`add_spatial_relations()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_spatial_relations.md)
  now supports `allow_self = TRUE` together with `directed = TRUE`.
  Diagonal entries `(i, i)` in directed relations are interpreted as
  unary planning-unit terms rather than as directed self-dependencies.
- Fragmentation objectives for planning units and actions now handle
  diagonal terms consistently for both directed and undirected spatial
  relations.

## multiscape 1.2.0

### Objective and decision-space analysis

- Added
  [`frontier_neighbors()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_neighbors.md),
  [`linkage_distances()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_distances.md),
  [`linkage_transition()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_transition.md),
  [`linkage_turnover()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_turnover.md),
  and
  [`linkage_contrasts()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_contrasts.md)
  for objective–decision linkage analysis.
- Added
  [`get_solution_states()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_solution_states.md)
  and
  [`selection_consistency()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/selection_consistency.md)
  for summarizing spatial decisions across solutions.
- Standardized public solution identifiers as positive integers.

### Solver configuration

- Added solver-specific validation of unsupported parameters, which are
  now reported and ignored before solving.
- Disabled automatic solver logs and explicit thread limits by default.
- Fixed CPLEX thread handling, Gurobi log-file naming, CBC solution
  limits, and preservation of `gap_limit` precision.

### Spatial fragmentation

- Preserved directed spatial relations during model construction.
- Fragmentation objectives now distinguish directed arcs from undirected
  edges and reject duplicated relations.

### Documentation

- Reorganized the package reference and workflow around Problem and
  SolutionSet, with dedicated objective-space (frontier\_*()),
  decision-space (selection\_*()), and linkage (linkage\_\*()) function
  families.
- Updated examples and documentation to use the common simulated
  multi-action problem across the new analysis functions.

## multiscape 1.1.3

### Documentation and examples

- Replaced the extended README case study with a concise, spatially
  structured example of multi-objective, multi-action planning.
- Added
  [`load_sim_multiaction()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/load_sim_multiaction.md)
  and its associated simulated planning units, features, action costs,
  and action-specific effects for examples, tests, and introductory
  documentation.
- Added a detailed vignette on multi-objective forest-restoration
  planning in a highly productive landscape with an existing
  conservation network.
- Formulated restoration cost and four ecosystem-service
  opportunity-cost objectives specifically for the `restoration` action,
  while retaining fixed conservation commitments as spatial context.
- Demonstrated an a posteriori AUGMECON workflow with 81 threshold
  configurations, non-dominance filtering, removal of repeated decision
  vectors, objective extremes, closest-to-ideal compromise selection,
  and decision-space comparisons.
- Added a compressed, precomputed `SolutionSet` to support reproducible
  vignette and pkgdown builds without requiring Gurobi or rerunning the
  full optimization.
- Added visual summaries for additional cost versus ecosystem-service
  opportunity cost, normalized objective performance, joint
  ecosystem-service regret, representative spatial allocations, and
  Jaccard similarity among efficient plans.
- Linked objective-space and map diagnostics through consistent solution
  identifiers and colours for the least-cost plan, the five-objective
  compromise, and service-specific extremes.

## multiscape 1.1.2

- Relaxed model validation so feature targets are no longer mandatory
  when another substantive constraint or locked-in decision defines a
  non-empty planning problem.
- Added an informative warning for minimum-cost problems that have no
  feature targets, positive area requirement, or locked-in decisions,
  instead of stopping model construction unconditionally.

### Result tables and maintenance

- Standardized user-facing result tables so `solution_id` is shown as
  the first column.
- Removed `run_id` from user-facing solution extractors and frontier
  outputs; it is now kept for
  [`get_runs()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_runs.md)
  and internal matching only.
- Removed internal columns such as `internal_id` from planning-unit
  outputs.
- Fixed
  [`get_targets()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_targets.md)
  so it consistently returns `solution_id` instead of `run_id`.
- Updated
  [`frontier_extremes()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_extremes.md)
  and
  [`frontier_distances()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_distances.md)
  to follow the same `solution_id`-based output convention.
- Added an example for
  [`get_runs()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_runs.md).
- Fixed Rd warnings from missing cross-references and undocumented
  deprecated arguments.

## multiscape 1.1.1

### User-facing API

- Renamed planning-unit functions and arguments to use `planning_units`
  consistently instead of `pu`.

- Deprecated older function aliases kept for backwards compatibility:

  - [`get_pu()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_pu.md)
    in favour of
    [`get_planning_units()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_planning_units.md);
  - [`plot_spatial_pu()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/plot_spatial_pu.md)
    in favour of
    [`plot_spatial_planning_units()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/plot_spatial_planning_units.md);
  - [`add_constraint_locked_pu()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_constraint_locked_pu.md)
    in favour of the planning-unit naming convention;
  - [`add_objective_min_fragmentation_pu()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_objective_min_fragmentation_pu.md)
    in favour of
    [`add_objective_min_fragmentation_planning_units()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_objective_min_fragmentation_planning_units.md).

- Deprecated older multi-objective run helpers:

  - [`run_grid()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/run_grid.md)
    in favour of
    [`set_runs_grid()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_runs_grid.md);
  - [`run_manual()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/run_manual.md)
    in favour of
    [`set_runs_manual()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_runs_manual.md);
  - [`mo_control()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/mo_control.md)
    in favour of
    [`set_runs_control()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_runs_control.md).

### Solution and result extractors

- Simplified public result tables to use `solution_id` as the main
  identifier for stored solutions.
- Kept `run_id` primarily for
  [`get_runs()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_runs.md)
  and internal diagnostics, reducing ambiguity in user-facing summary
  outputs.
- Updated
  [`get_objectives()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_objectives.md)
  to return cleaner user-facing tables while preserving run-level
  identifiers internally for frontier and dominance calculations.
- Updated getters, plotting functions, and error messages to use
  `solution`/`solutions` terminology consistently.

### Multi-objective methods

- Updated weighted-sum defaults so that automatic grids are normalized
  by default, while manual weight designs use the supplied weights
  exactly.
- Allowed manual weighted-sum weights to be non-negative and have any
  positive row total when `normalize_weights = FALSE`.
- Improved validation of manual weighted-sum designs and multi-objective
  control objects.
- Removed outdated internal `feasible_only` handling from objective
  extraction workflows.

### Maintenance

- Updated tests to reflect the new `solution_id`-based public API.
- Improved internal separation between user-facing extractors and
  run-level helper functions.
- Fixed inconsistencies in deprecated `run` terminology across getters,
  plotting, and frontier utilities.

## multiscape 1.1.0

### Solution architecture

- Simplified the public result architecture so that
  [`solve()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solve.md)
  consistently returns a `SolutionSet`, including for single-objective
  problems.
- Removed the internal `Solution` class from the public API and
  documentation. Individual run-level solutions remain available only as
  internal components of a `SolutionSet`.
- Added stable `solution_id` identifiers to distinguish stored solutions
  from attempted runs identified by `run_id`.
- Updated run, solution, and summary tables to preserve `run_id` and
  `solution_id` consistently across extraction and analysis functions.
- Improved internal finalization of solution metadata and identifiers
  after solving.
- Updated `SolutionSet` printing and documentation to reflect the
  distinction between run attempts and stored solutions.

### Base conservation-planning workflow

- Added automatic support for base conservation-planning problems when
  no explicit actions or effects are supplied.
- Problems without explicit actions are now interpreted as binary
  conservation decisions, where each planning unit can be conserved or
  not conserved.
- Added an implicit conservation action and internally generated feature
  contributions based on the feature amounts stored in `dist_features`.
- The implicit conservation model uses `amount_after` to represent the
  feature amount obtained when a planning unit is conserved.

### Multi-objective run design and controls

- Revised the multi-objective run-design resolver used by weighted-sum,
  epsilon-constraint, and AUGMECON methods.
- Improved support for automatic and manually specified run designs
  through
  [`run_grid()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/run_grid.md)
  and
  [`run_manual()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/run_manual.md).
- Added and documented common multi-objective execution controls through
  [`mo_control()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/mo_control.md).
- Improved handling of infeasible runs, missing solutions, solver
  errors, and slack upper bounds.
- Standardized the storage of run-design parameters and objective values
  in the `SolutionSet` run table.
- Preserved infeasible runs in the run history while assigning
  `solution_id` only to runs that produced a stored solution.
- Improved objective evaluation and model preparation across
  multi-objective methods.
- Fixed weighted-sum objective preparation for implicit conservation
  benefit objectives.
- Improved validation of objective coefficient vectors and
  objective-specific error messages.

### Result extraction

- Added
  [`get_runs()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_runs.md)
  to extract run-level status, runtime, gap, design parameters, solution
  identifiers, and objective values.
- Added
  [`get_objectives()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_objectives.md)
  to extract objective values in long or wide format.
- Added `get_objective_specs()` to extract registered objective aliases,
  objective types, model types, optimization senses, and creation
  metadata.
- Updated objective extraction to include both `run_id` and
  `solution_id`.
- Updated existing extraction functions to work consistently with the
  unified `SolutionSet` architecture.
- Improved handling of infeasible runs and missing objective values
  during extraction.

### Solution-set management

- Added
  [`solution_filter()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution_filter.md)
  to return a coherently filtered `SolutionSet`.
- [`solution_filter()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution_filter.md)
  can filter by `run_id`, `solution_id`, solver status, or feasibility.
- Added optional filtering of non-dominated solutions using `moocore`.
- Added support for selecting the objectives used to evaluate dominance.
- Ensured that filtering updates run tables, design tables, stored
  solutions, and summary tables consistently.
- Added cloning of `SolutionSet` objects before modification to prevent
  reference-based mutation of the original object.
- Added
  [`solution_append()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution_append.md)
  to combine compatible `SolutionSet` objects generated from the same
  planning problem.
- [`solution_append()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution_append.md)
  verifies compatibility of planning units, features, actions, effects,
  targets, constraints, locks, spatial relations, and objective
  definitions.
- Appended runs and solutions are automatically assigned unique `run_id`
  and `solution_id` values.
- Added support for combining solution sets obtained from different
  multi-objective methods or run designs applied to the same planning
  problem.
- Added
  [`solution_unique()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution_unique.md)
  to retain one representative from groups of equivalent solutions.
- [`solution_unique()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution_unique.md)
  can identify repeated solutions using either complete decision vectors
  or objective values.
- Added numerical tolerance controls for identifying equivalent points
  in objective space.
- Preserved runs without stored solutions when removing duplicated
  solutions.

### Frontier analysis

- Added
  [`frontier_extremes()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_extremes.md)
  to identify the observed minimum and maximum values of each objective.
- Added classification of observed bounds as `best` or `worst` according
  to each objective’s optimization sense.
- Added support for returning all tied extreme solutions or only the
  first representative.
- Added
  [`frontier_distances()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_distances.md)
  to calculate normalized distances to observed ideal and nadir points.
- Added automatic transformation of maximization objectives into a
  common minimization space for frontier calculations.
- Added range normalization so that objectives measured in different
  units contribute comparably to distance calculations.
- Added Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distance metrics.
- Added rankings based on proximity to the observed ideal point and
  distance from the observed nadir point.
- Added original-scale ideal, nadir, and objective-range metadata to the
  returned distance tables.
- Clarified that frontier reference points are calculated from the
  solutions contained in the supplied `SolutionSet`.

### Selection analysis

- Added
  [`selection_frequency()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/selection_frequency.md)
  to calculate how frequently each planning-unit/action assignment is
  selected across stored solutions.
- Standardized selection analysis around a canonical
  planning-unit/action representation.
- Simple conservation-planning problems are represented using the
  implicit `conservation` action.
- Added
  [`selection_similarity()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/selection_similarity.md)
  to quantify structural similarity among solutions.
- Added Jaccard similarity for comparing selected planning-unit/action
  assignments.
- Added Hamming similarity for comparing complete binary assignment
  vectors, including shared non-selections.
- Added long-format and matrix-format similarity outputs.
- Added internal helpers to construct consistent long-format and
  matrix-format selection representations.
