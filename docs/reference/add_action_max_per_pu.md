# Limit the number of actions per planning unit (maximum)

Store a constraint that limits the number of actions that can be
selected within each planning unit (PU). The constraint has the form:
\$\$\sum\_{a \in A} x\_{pu,a} \le \mathrm{max}\$\$ for each PU in the
selected set.

This function is **data-only**: it records the constraint specification
in the `Problem` object but does not build or modify the optimization
model. The constraint is later translated into linear constraints by the
model builder (e.g., `.pa_build_model_apply_constraints()`).

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Problem` object created with
  [`create_problem`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/create_problem.md).
  Must already contain actions (i.e., run
  [`add_actions`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_actions.md)
  first).

- max:

  Integer scalar \\\ge 0\\. Maximum number of actions allowed per PU.
  Default is `1L`.

- pu:

  Optional integer vector of planning unit ids (external ids, i.e.,
  `x$data$pu$id`) to which the constraint is applied. If `NULL`
  (default), the constraint applies to all PUs.

- actions:

  Optional character vector of action ids (i.e., `x$data$actions$id`) to
  include in the sum. If `NULL` (default), all actions are included.

- overwrite:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, replace any existing `action_max_per_pu`
  constraint stored in `x$data$constraints`. If `FALSE` (default) and a
  constraint already exists, an error is raised.

## Value

The updated `Problem` object with `x$data$constraints$action_max_per_pu`
set to a list containing the constraint specification.

## Details

The constraint can be applied to:

- all planning units and all actions (default), or

- a subset of planning units via `pu`, and/or

- a subset of actions via `actions`.

Note that the subset is applied over the existing feasible
`(pu, action)` pairs in `x$data$dist_actions`. If the requested
`pu`/`actions` subset yields zero feasible pairs, the function stops
with an informative error.

If `x$data$model_ptr` is already present (a model has been built
previously), the function marks the model as dirty by setting
`x$data$meta$model_dirty <- TRUE`, signalling that the model should be
rebuilt before solving.
