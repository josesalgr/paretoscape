# Filter solutions in a solution set

Return a reduced
[`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
object containing only the runs or solutions that match the requested
filters.

This function is intended to curate `SolutionSet` objects before
downstream analysis, plotting, frontier analysis, or post-hoc
evaluation. It filters all relevant components of the object
consistently, including the run table, design table, stored run-level
solutions, and available summary tables.

## Usage

``` r
solution_filter(
  x,
  run_id = NULL,
  solution_id = NULL,
  status = NULL,
  feasible_only = FALSE,
  nondominated = FALSE,
  objectives = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A
  [`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
  object returned by
  [`solve`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solve.md).

- run_id:

  Optional integer vector of run ids to keep.

- solution_id:

  Optional numeric vector of positive integer solution ids to keep. Runs
  without a stored solution are never matched by this filter.

- status:

  Optional character vector of run statuses to keep. Matching is
  case-insensitive.

- feasible_only:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, keep only runs whose status is interpreted as
  having produced a usable solution. The current accepted statuses are
  `"optimal"`, `"feasible"`, `"suboptimal"`, `"time_limit"`,
  `"time_limit_feasible"`, `"gap_limit"`, `"gap_limit_feasible"`, and
  `"solution_limit"`.

- nondominated:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, keep only non-dominated solutions among the runs
  retained by the other filters. This uses moocore internally.

- objectives:

  Optional character vector of objective names to use when
  `nondominated = TRUE`. If `NULL`, all available objective-value
  columns are used.

## Value

A filtered
[`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
object.

## Details

A `SolutionSet` distinguishes between runs and stored solutions.

- `run_id` identifies a run or attempted solve. Runs may be feasible,
  optimal, infeasible, failed, or otherwise incomplete.

- `solution_id` identifies a stored solution. Runs that did not produce
  a solution have `solution_id = NA`.

Therefore, filtering by `run_id` and filtering by `solution_id` are not
always equivalent. For example, an infeasible run may have a `run_id`
but no `solution_id`.

The function filters:

- `x$solution$runs`, using the selected `run_id`s;

- `x$solution$design`, when it contains a `run_id` column;

- `x$solution$solutions`, using the selected `solution_id`s;

- all tables in `x$summary` that contain a `run_id` column.

The function does not renumber `run_id` or `solution_id`. This preserves
traceability to the original run design.

If more than one filter is supplied, filters are combined using logical
*and*. For example, setting both `status = "optimal"` and
`solution_id = c(1, 3)` keeps only optimal runs whose `solution_id` is
either `1` or `3`.

If `nondominated = TRUE`, the function further keeps only non-dominated
solutions among the runs retained by the previous filters. Dominance is
evaluated in objective space using the objective values stored in the
run table. Objective senses are obtained from the objective
specifications stored in the original problem.

Non-dominated filtering requires the moocore package.
