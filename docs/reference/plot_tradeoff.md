# Plot trade-offs from a multi-objective solution set

Plot pairwise trade-offs among objective values stored in a
`SolutionSet`.

This function is intended for multi-objective workflows in which the
solution set contains one row per run and one or more objective value
columns of the form `value_*`.

If exactly two objectives are selected, the function returns a single
scatterplot. If three or more objectives are selected, all pairwise
combinations are plotted using facets.

## Usage

``` r
plot_tradeoff(
  x,
  objectives = NULL,
  color_by = NULL,
  all_pairs = NULL,
  connect = FALSE,
  label_runs = FALSE,
  point_size = 2.5,
  line_alpha = 0.6,
  text_size = 3,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `SolutionSet` object.

- objectives:

  Optional character vector of objective aliases to display. These must
  match the suffixes of the `value_*` columns in `x$solution$runs`. If
  `NULL`, all available objective columns are used.

- color_by:

  Optional character scalar used to colour points. This may be either
  one of the selected objective aliases or one of the run-level columns
  `"run_id"`, `"status"`, `"runtime"`, or `"gap"`.

- all_pairs:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, allow plotting all pairwise combinations even when
  more than four objectives are selected. If `NULL`, it is treated as
  `FALSE`.

- connect:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, connect points by run order within each panel.

- label_runs:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, add run labels to points.

- point_size:

  Numeric point size.

- line_alpha:

  Numeric alpha value for connecting lines.

- text_size:

  Numeric size for run labels.

- ...:

  Reserved for future extensions.

## Value

Invisibly returns a `ggplot` object.

## Details

This function reads the run-level table stored in `x$solution$runs`. It
expects objective values to be stored in columns whose names begin with
`"value_"`.

If the available objective columns are, for example, `value_cost`,
`value_benefit`, and `value_frag`, then the corresponding objective
aliases are `"cost"`, `"benefit"`, and `"frag"`.

Let \\f_k(r)\\ denote the value of objective \\k\\ in run \\r\\. This
function visualizes pairwise projections of the run table of the form:
\$\$ \left(f_k(r), f\_\ell(r)\right) \$\$ for selected pairs of
objectives \\k,\ell\\.

If exactly two objectives are selected, a single panel is produced.

If three or more objectives are selected, all pairwise combinations are
generated: \$\$ \\(k,\ell): k \< \ell,\\ k,\ell \in \mathcal{O}\\, \$\$
where \\\mathcal{O}\\ is the selected set of objective aliases.

By default, plotting more than four objectives is not allowed unless
`all_pairs = TRUE`, because the number of panels grows quadratically in
the number of objectives.

**Colouring**

If `color_by` is supplied, points are coloured by either:

- one of the selected objective aliases, in which case the corresponding
  `value_*` column is used,

- or one of the run-level columns `run_id`, `status`, `runtime`, or
  `gap`.

**Connecting runs**

If `connect = TRUE`, runs are connected in their current table order
within each panel. This can be useful when runs correspond to an ordered
scan of weights, \\\epsilon\\-levels, or frontier points, but it should
be used with care when run order has no substantive meaning.

**Run labels**

If `label_runs = TRUE`, each point is labelled by its `run_id`. If the
ggrepel package is available, repelled labels are used.
