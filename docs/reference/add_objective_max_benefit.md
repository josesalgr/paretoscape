# Add objective: maximize benefit

Define an objective that maximizes the total positive effects generated
by selected actions on selected features.

This objective is based on the canonical effects table stored in
`x$data$dist_effects` and uses only the non-negative `benefit`
component.

## Usage

``` r
add_objective_max_benefit(x, actions = NULL, features = NULL, alias = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Problem` object.

- actions:

  Optional subset of actions to include in the objective. Values may
  match `x$data$actions$id` and, if present,
  `x$data$actions$action_set`. If `NULL`, all actions are included.

- features:

  Optional subset of features to include in the objective. Values may
  match `x$data$features$id` and, if present, `x$data$features$name`. If
  `NULL`, all features are included.

- alias:

  Optional identifier used to register this objective for
  multi-objective workflows.

## Value

An updated `Problem` object.

## Details

Let \\\mathcal{E}\\ denote the set of rows in `x$data$dist_effects`. For
each row associated with planning unit \\i\\, action \\a\\, and feature
\\f\\, let \\b\_{iaf} \ge 0\\ denote the stored value in the `benefit`
column.

Since `dist_effects` is already expressed in canonical form,
\\b\_{iaf}\\ represents the positive part of the net effect associated
with the corresponding selected action decision.

If no subsets are supplied, the objective can be written as:

\$\$ \max \sum\_{(i,a,f) \in \mathcal{E}} b\_{iaf} \\ x\_{ia}, \$\$

where \\x\_{ia} \in \\0,1\\\\ indicates whether action \\a\\ is selected
in planning unit \\i\\.

If `actions` is provided, only rows whose action belongs to the selected
subset contribute to the objective.

If `features` is provided, only rows whose feature belongs to the
selected subset contribute to the objective.

More generally, letting \\\mathcal{E}^{\star}\\ be the subset induced by
the selected actions and features, the objective is:

\$\$ \max \sum\_{(i,a,f) \in \mathcal{E}^{\star}} b\_{iaf} \\ x\_{ia}.
\$\$

This objective maximizes gains only. It does not subtract losses. If the
user wishes to account for harmful effects as well, losses should be
handled separately through additional objectives or constraints.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
p <- add_objective_max_benefit(p)

p <- add_objective_max_benefit(
  p,
  actions = c("restoration", "conservation")
)

p <- add_objective_max_benefit(
  p,
  features = c("sp1", "sp3")
)

p <- add_objective_max_benefit(
  p,
  actions = "restoration",
  features = c("sp1", "sp2")
)
} # }
```
