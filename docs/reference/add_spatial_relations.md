# Add spatial relations

Register an externally computed spatial relation inside a `Problem`
object using the unified internal representation adopted by
`multiscape`.

Most users will typically prefer one of the convenience constructors
such as
[`add_spatial_boundary`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_spatial_boundary.md),
[`add_spatial_rook`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_spatial_rook.md),
[`add_spatial_queen`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_spatial_queen.md),
[`add_spatial_knn`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_spatial_knn.md),
or
[`add_spatial_distance`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_spatial_distance.md).
This function is the advanced low-level entry point for adding an
already computed relation.

## Usage

``` r
add_spatial_relations(x, relations, name, directed = FALSE, allow_self = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Problem` object created with
  [`create_problem`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/create_problem.md).

- relations:

  A `data.frame` describing relation edges. It must contain either:

  - `pu1`, `pu2`, and `weight`, using external planning-unit ids, or

  - `internal_pu1`, `internal_pu2`, and `weight`, using internal
    planning-unit indices.

  Extra columns such as `distance` or `source` are allowed and are
  preserved when possible.

- name:

  Character string giving the key under which the relation is stored.

- directed:

  Logical. If `FALSE`, treat rows as undirected edges; each unordered
  pair must occur exactly once. If `TRUE`, keep rows as directed ordered
  pairs; reciprocal arcs are distinct, but duplicate arcs are rejected.

- allow_self:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, allow diagonal entries \\(i,i)\\. In fragmentation
  objectives, diagonal entries contribute as unary terms associated with
  the corresponding planning unit. Default is `FALSE`.

## Value

An updated `Problem` object with the relation stored in
`x$data$spatial_relations[[name]]`.

## Details

Use this function when the spatial relation has already been computed
externally and should be registered directly in the `Problem` object.

The input relation may be provided either in terms of external
planning-unit identifiers or in terms of internal planning-unit indices.

Specifically, the input `relations` table must contain either:

- `pu1`, `pu2`, and `weight`, or

- `internal_pu1`, `internal_pu2`, and `weight`.

If external ids are supplied, they are mapped to internal indices using
the planning-unit identifiers stored in the problem.

Let \\G = (\mathcal{I}, E, \omega)\\ denote the supplied relation, where
\\E\\ corresponds to the rows of `relations`. If `directed = FALSE`,
each edge is treated as undirected, so pairs \\(i,j)\\ and \\(j,i)\\ are
interpreted as the same edge. In that case, each unordered pair must be
supplied exactly once. Duplicate undirected edges are rejected,
including reciprocal rows.

If `directed = TRUE`, edges are preserved as ordered pairs, so \\(i,j)\\
and \\(j,i)\\ are distinct unless the user provides both.

\#' Self-edges \\(i,i)\\ are permitted only if `allow_self = TRUE`. In
fragmentation objectives, diagonal entries are interpreted as unary
planning-unit terms \\\omega\_{ii} x_i\\, including for directed
relations; they are not interpreted as directed self-dependencies.

The final relation is stored in `x$data$spatial_relations[[name]]`.

If a relation with the same `name` already exists, it is replaced.

## Examples

``` r
# Load a complete simulated planning problem.
example_data <- load_sim_multiaction()

p <- create_problem(
  pu = example_data$planning_units,
  features = example_data$features,
  dist_features = example_data$dist_features,
  cost = "cost"
)

rel <- data.frame(
  pu1 = c(1, 1, 2),
  pu2 = c(2, 3, 3),
  weight = c(1, 1, 2)
)

p <- add_spatial_relations(
  x = p,
  relations = rel,
  name = "my_relation"
)

p$data$spatial_relations$my_relation

#> 1            1            2      1   1   2   my_relation    FALSE
#> 2            1            3      1   1   3   my_relation    FALSE
#> 3            2            3      2   2   3   my_relation    FALSE
