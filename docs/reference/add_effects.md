# Add action effects to a planning problem

Define the effects of management actions on features across planning
units.

Effects are stored in a canonical representation in
`x$data$dist_effects`, with one row per `(pu, action, feature)` triple
and two non-negative columns:

- `benefit`: the positive component of the effect,

- `loss`: the magnitude of the negative component of the effect.

The net effect is therefore interpreted as \$\$ \Delta\_{i a f} =
\mathrm{benefit}\_{i a f} - \mathrm{loss}\_{i a f}, \$\$ where \\i\\
indexes planning units, \\a\\ indexes actions, and \\f\\ indexes
features.

Under the semantics adopted by this package, each
`(pu, action, feature)` triple represents a single net effect.
Consequently, after validation and aggregation, a stored row cannot have
both `benefit > 0` and `loss > 0` at the same time.

## Usage

``` r
add_effects(
  x,
  effects = NULL,
  effect_type = c("delta", "after"),
  effect_aggregation = c("sum", "mean"),
  component = c("any", "benefit", "loss")
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Problem` object created with
  [`create_problem`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/create_problem.md).
  It must already contain `x$data$dist_actions`; run
  [`add_actions`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_actions.md)
  first.

- effects:

  Effect specification. One of:

  - `NULL`, to store an empty effects table,

  - a `data.frame(action, feature, multiplier)`,

  - a `data.frame(pu, action, feature, ...)` with explicit effects,

  - a named list of
    [`terra::SpatRaster`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/SpatRaster-class.html)
    objects, one per action.

- effect_type:

  Character string indicating how supplied effect values are
  interpreted. Must be one of:

  - `"delta"`: values represent signed net changes,

  - `"after"`: values represent after-action amounts and are converted
    to net changes relative to baseline feature amounts.

- effect_aggregation:

  Character string giving the aggregation used when converting raster
  values to planning-unit level. Must be one of `"sum"` or `"mean"`.

- component:

  Character string controlling which component of the canonical effects
  table is retained. Must be one of:

  - `"any"`: keep all non-zero rows,

  - `"benefit"`: keep only rows with `benefit > 0`,

  - `"loss"`: keep only rows with `loss > 0`.

## Value

An updated `Problem` object with:

- `x$data$dist_effects`:

  A canonical effects table with columns `pu`, `action`, `feature`,
  `benefit`, `loss`, `internal_pu`, `internal_action`,
  `internal_feature`, and optional labels such as `feature_name` and
  `action_name`.

- `x$data$effects_meta`:

  Metadata describing how effects were interpreted and stored.

## Details

This function provides a unified interface for specifying action effects
from several input formats while enforcing a single internal
representation. Regardless of how the user supplies the effects, the
stored output always follows the same canonical structure based on
non-negative `benefit`/`loss` components.

Let \\b\_{if}\\ denote the baseline amount of feature \\f\\ in planning
unit \\i\\, taken from `x$data$dist_features$amount`. Let \\\Delta\_{i a
f}\\ denote the net change caused by applying action \\a\\ in planning
unit \\i\\ to feature \\f\\. The canonical stored representation is:

\$\$ \mathrm{benefit}\_{i a f} = \max(\Delta\_{i a f}, 0), \$\$

\$\$ \mathrm{loss}\_{i a f} = \max(-\Delta\_{i a f}, 0). \$\$

Hence:

- if \\\Delta\_{i a f} \> 0\\, then `benefit > 0` and `loss = 0`,

- if \\\Delta\_{i a f} \< 0\\, then `benefit = 0` and `loss > 0`,

- if \\\Delta\_{i a f} = 0\\, then both are zero.

**Why split effects into benefit and loss?**

This representation avoids ambiguity in downstream optimization models.
It allows the package to support, for example, objectives that maximize
beneficial effects, minimize damages, impose no-net-loss conditions, or
combine both components differently in multi-objective formulations.

**Supported effect specifications**

The `effects` argument may be provided in one of the following forms:

1.  `NULL`. An empty effects table is stored.

2.  A `data.frame(action, feature, multiplier)`. In this case, effects
    are constructed by multiplying baseline feature amounts by the
    supplied multiplier: \$\$ \Delta\_{i a f} = b\_{if} \times m\_{a f},
    \$\$ where \\m\_{a f}\\ is the multiplier associated with action
    \\a\\ and feature \\f\\. This specification is expanded over all
    feasible `(pu, action)` pairs.

3.  A `data.frame(pu, action, feature, ...)` giving explicit effects for
    individual triples. The table may contain:

    - `delta` or `effect`: interpreted as signed net changes,

    - `after`: interpreted as after-action amounts if
      `effect_type = "after"`,

    - `benefit` and/or `loss`: explicit non-negative split components,

    - legacy signed `benefit` without `loss`: interpreted as a signed
      net effect for backwards compatibility.

4.  A named list of
    [`terra::SpatRaster`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/SpatRaster-class.html)
    objects, one per action. In this case, names must match action ids,
    and each raster must contain one layer per feature. Raster values
    are aggregated to planning-unit level using `effect_aggregation`.

**Interpretation of `effect_type`**

If `effect_type = "delta"`, supplied values are interpreted as net
changes directly.

If `effect_type = "after"`, supplied values are interpreted as
after-action amounts and converted internally to net effects using:

\$\$ \Delta\_{i a f} = \mathrm{after}\_{i a f} - b\_{if}. \$\$

Missing baseline values are treated as zero.

**Feasibility and locked-out decisions**

Effects are only retained for feasible `(pu, action)` pairs listed in
`x$data$dist_actions`. Thus,
[`add_actions()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_actions.md)
must be called first. Pairs marked as locked out (`status == 3`) are
removed before storing the final effects table.

**Duplicate rows and semantic validation**

If multiple rows are supplied for the same `(pu, action, feature)`
triple, they are aggregated by summing `benefit` and `loss` separately.
The resulting triple must still respect the package semantics, namely
that both components cannot be strictly positive simultaneously. Inputs
violating this rule are rejected.

**Component selection**

After canonicalization and validation, rows can be restricted to:

- `component = "any"`: keep all non-zero effects,

- `component = "benefit"`: keep only rows with `benefit > 0`,

- `component = "loss"`: keep only rows with `loss > 0`.

Rows with `benefit = 0` and `loss = 0` are always removed.

**Raster handling**

When effects are supplied as rasters, they are automatically aligned to
the planning-unit raster or geometry when needed before extraction or
zonal aggregation.

**Stored output**

The resulting table `x$data$dist_effects` contains user-facing ids,
internal integer ids, and optional labels for actions and features.
Metadata describing the stored representation and input interpretation
are written to `x$data$effects_meta`.
