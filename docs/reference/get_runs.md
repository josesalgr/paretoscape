# Get run-level metadata from a solution set

Extract the run table from a
[`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
object.

## Usage

``` r
get_runs(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A
  [`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
  object returned by
  [`solve`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solve.md).

## Value

A `data.frame` with one row per attempted optimization run. The table
contains run metadata and the numeric mapping between `run_id` and
`solution_id`, but not objective-value columns.

## Details

A run represents an attempted optimization solve. Each run has a unique
`run_id`. Only runs that produce a stored solution receive a
`solution_id`.

The `solution_id` is numeric and matches the corresponding `run_id`.
Therefore, if a run fails or is infeasible, its `solution_id` is `NA`;
if a later run succeeds, its `solution_id` keeps the same value as its
`run_id`.

This function is the user-facing place where the relationship between
attempted runs and stored solutions is reported.

Objective values are not returned by `get_runs()`. To extract objective
values, use
[`get_objectives`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_objectives.md).
