# Add relative targets

Add feature-level relative targets to a planning problem.

These targets are stored in `x$data$targets` and later translated into
linear constraints when the optimization model is built.

Relative targets are supplied as proportions in \\\[0,1\]\\ and are
converted internally into absolute thresholds using the current total
amount of each feature in the landscape.

Each call appends one or more target definitions to the problem. This
makes it possible to combine multiple target rules, including targets
associated with different action subsets.

## Usage

``` r
add_targets_relative(x, targets, features = NULL, actions = NULL, label = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Problem` object.

- targets:

  Target specification as proportions in \\\[0,1\]\\. It may be a
  scalar, vector, named vector, or `data.frame`. See Details.

- features:

  Optional feature specification indicating which features the supplied
  target values refer to when `targets` does not identify features
  explicitly. If `NULL`, all features are targeted.

- actions:

  Optional character vector indicating which actions count toward target
  achievement. Entries may match action ids, `action_set` labels, or
  both. If `NULL`, all actions count.

- label:

  Optional character string stored with the targets for reporting and
  bookkeeping.

## Value

An updated `Problem` object with relative targets appended to
`x$data$targets`.

## Details

Let \\\mathcal{F}\\ denote the set of features. For each targeted
feature \\f \in \mathcal{F}\\, let \\B_f\\ denote the current baseline
total amount of that feature in the landscape, as computed by
`.pa_feature_totals()`.

If the user supplies a relative target \\r_f \in \[0,1\]\\, then this
function converts it to an absolute threshold: \$\$ T_f = r_f \times
B_f. \$\$

The absolute threshold \\T_f\\ is stored in `target_value`, while:

- the original user-supplied proportion \\r_f\\ is stored in
  `target_raw`,

- the baseline total \\B_f\\ is stored in `basis_total`.

When the optimization model is built, the resulting target is
interpreted as: \$\$ \sum\_{(i,a) \in \mathcal{S}\_f} c\_{iaf} x\_{ia}
\ge T_f, \$\$ where:

- \\x\_{ia}\\ indicates whether action \\a\\ is selected in planning
  unit \\i\\,

- \\c\_{iaf}\\ is the contribution of that action to feature \\f\\,

- \\\mathcal{S}\_f\\ is the set of planning unit–action pairs allowed to
  count toward achievement of the target.

The `actions` argument restricts which actions may contribute toward
target achievement, but it does not affect the baseline amount \\B_f\\
used to compute the threshold. In other words, relative targets are
always scaled against the current full landscape baseline computed by
`.pa_feature_totals()`.

The `targets` argument is parsed by `.pa_parse_targets()` and may be
supplied in several equivalent forms, including:

- a single numeric value recycled to all selected features,

- a numeric vector aligned to `features`,

- a named numeric vector where names identify features,

- a `data.frame` with `feature` and `target` columns.

If `targets` does not explicitly identify features:

- if `features = NULL`, the target is applied to all features,

- if `features` is supplied, the target values are interpreted with
  respect to that feature set.

Relative targets must lie in \\\[0,1\]\\.

Internally, targets added by this function are stored with:

- `type = "actions"`,

- `sense = "ge"`,

- `target_unit = "relative_baseline"`,

- `target_raw = r_f`,

- `basis_total = B_f`,

- `target_value`, equal to \\r_f B_f\\.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Require 30% of the current baseline total for all features
p <- add_targets_relative(p, 0.3)

# Require 20% of baseline totals for selected features only
p <- add_targets_relative(
  p,
  0.2,
  features = c("sp1", "sp2")
)

# Require 20% of baseline totals, counting only recovery actions
p <- add_targets_relative(
  p,
  0.2,
  actions = "recovery"
)

# Combine multiple target rules
p <- p |>
  add_targets_relative(0.1, actions = "conservation") |>
  add_targets_absolute(100, actions = "restoration")
} # }
```
