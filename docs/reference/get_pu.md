# Get planning-unit results from a solution set

**\[deprecated\]**

`get_pu()` has been replaced by

## Usage

``` r
get_pu(x, solution = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  [`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
  object returned by
  [`solve`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solve.md).

- solution:

  Optional positive integer giving the solution id to extract. If
  `NULL`, all solutions are returned when available.

- ...:

  Deprecated arguments kept for backwards compatibility. Currently
  supports `run` and `solution_id`, which are redirected to `solution`.
