# Add management actions to a planning problem

Define the action catalogue, the set of feasible planning unit–action
pairs, and their implementation costs.

This function adds two core components to a `Problem` object. First, it
stores the action catalogue in `x$data$actions`. Second, it creates the
feasible planning unit–action table in `x$data$dist_actions`, including
implementation costs, status codes, and internal indices used by the
optimization backend.

Conceptually, if \\\mathcal{P}\\ is the set of planning units and
\\\mathcal{A}\\ is the set of actions, this function defines a feasible
set \\\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{A}\\ together
with a non-negative cost function \\c : \mathcal{F} \to \mathbb{R}\_{\ge
0}\\.

## Usage

``` r
add_actions(
  x,
  actions,
  include_pairs = NULL,
  exclude_pairs = NULL,
  cost = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Problem` object created with
  [`create_problem`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/create_problem.md).

- actions:

  A `data.frame` defining the action catalogue. It must contain a unique
  `id` column. A column named `action` is also accepted and
  automatically renamed to `id`.

- include_pairs:

  Optional specification of feasible `(pu, action)` pairs. It can be
  `NULL`, a `data.frame` with columns `pu` and `action` (optionally also
  `feasible`), or a named list whose names are action ids and whose
  elements are vectors of planning unit ids or `sf` objects.

- exclude_pairs:

  Optional specification of infeasible `(pu, action)` pairs. It uses the
  same formats as `include_pairs` and removes matching pairs from the
  feasible set.

- cost:

  Optional cost specification for feasible pairs. It may be `NULL`, a
  scalar numeric value, a named numeric vector indexed by action id, or
  a `data.frame` with columns `action, cost` or `pu, action, cost`.

## Value

An updated `Problem` object with:

- `x$data$actions`:

  The action catalogue, including a unique integer `internal_id` for
  each action.

- `x$data$dist_actions`:

  The feasible planning unit–action table with columns `pu`, `action`,
  `cost`, `status`, `internal_pu`, and `internal_action`.

- `x$data$index$pu`:

  A mapping from user-supplied planning-unit ids to internal integer
  ids.

- `x$data$index$action`:

  A mapping from action ids to internal integer ids.

## Details

**Action catalogue.**

The `actions` argument must be a `data.frame` with a unique `id` column
identifying each action. If a column named `action` is supplied instead,
it is renamed internally to `id`. Additional columns are preserved. If
no `name` column is provided, action labels are taken from `id`. If an
`action_set` column is present, it is also preserved and can later be
used to refer to groups of actions.

Actions are stored sorted by `id` to ensure reproducible internal
indexing.

**Feasible planning unit–action pairs.**

Feasibility is controlled through `include_pairs` and `exclude_pairs`.

If `include_pairs = NULL`, all possible `(pu, action)` pairs are
initially considered feasible: \$\$ \mathcal{F} = \mathcal{P} \times
\mathcal{A}. \$\$

If `include_pairs` is supplied, only those pairs are retained in the
feasible set. If `exclude_pairs` is also supplied, matching pairs are
removed after applying `include_pairs`. Thus, in general: \$\$
\mathcal{F} = \left(\mathcal{F}\_{\mathrm{include}} \text{ or }
\mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{A}\right) \setminus
\mathcal{F}\_{\mathrm{exclude}}. \$\$

Both `include_pairs` and `exclude_pairs` can be specified as:

- `NULL`,

- a `data.frame` with columns `pu` and `action`,

- or a named list whose names are action ids.

When supplied as a `data.frame`, the object must contain columns `pu`
and `action`. An optional logical-like column `feasible` may also be
provided; only rows with `feasible = TRUE` are retained. Missing values
in `feasible` are treated as `FALSE`.

When supplied as a named list, names must match action ids. Each element
may contain either:

- a vector of planning-unit ids, or

- an `sf` object defining the spatial zone where the action is feasible.

In the spatial case, feasible planning units are identified using
[`sf::st_intersects()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_binary_pred.html)
against `x$data$pu_sf`.

**Feasibility versus decision fixing.**

This function only determines whether a `(pu, action)` pair exists in
the model. It does not force a feasible action to be selected or
forbidden beyond structural infeasibility. Fixed decisions should
instead be imposed later with
[`add_constraint_locked_actions`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_constraint_locked_actions.md).

**Costs.**

Costs can be supplied in several ways:

- If `cost = NULL`, all feasible pairs receive a default cost of `1`.

- If `cost` is a scalar, that value is assigned to all feasible pairs.

- If `cost` is a named numeric vector, names must match action ids and
  costs are assigned by action.

- If `cost` is a `data.frame`, it must define either:

  - action-level costs through columns `action` and `cost`, or

  - pair-specific costs through columns `pu`, `action`, and `cost`.

In all cases, costs must be finite and non-negative.

**Status values.**

Internally, all feasible pairs are initialized with `status = 0`,
meaning that the decision is free. If `x$data$pu$locked_out` exists and
a planning unit is marked as locked out, then all feasible actions in
that planning unit are assigned `status = 3`. This preserves consistency
with planning-unit exclusions already stored in the problem.

**Replacement behaviour.**

Calling `add_actions()` replaces any previous action catalogue and
feasible action table stored in the problem object.
