# Plot spatial feature values from a solution

Plot feature values in space from a `Solution` or `SolutionSet`.

This function combines baseline feature amounts from
`x$problem$data$dist_features` with positive effects induced by selected
actions to produce planning-unit-level feature maps.

## Usage

``` r
plot_spatial_features(
  x,
  runs = NULL,
  features = NULL,
  value = c("final", "baseline", "benefit"),
  layout = NULL,
  max_facets = 4L,
  ...,
  base_alpha = 0.1,
  selected_alpha = 0.9,
  base_fill = "grey92",
  base_color = NA,
  selected_color = NA,
  draw_borders = FALSE,
  show_base = TRUE,
  fill_na = "grey80",
  use_viridis = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Solution` or `SolutionSet` object.

- runs:

  Optional integer vector of run ids. If `NULL`, a `Solution` is used
  directly and a `SolutionSet` defaults to the first run.

- features:

  Optional feature subset to display. Matching is attempted against both
  feature ids and feature names.

- value:

  Character string indicating which feature quantity to plot. Must be
  one of `"final"`, `"baseline"`, or `"benefit"`.

- layout:

  Character string controlling the layout. Must be one of `"single"` or
  `"facet"`. If `NULL`, the default is `"facet"`.

- max_facets:

  Maximum number of feature facets shown when `features = NULL` and
  faceting would otherwise create many panels.

- ...:

  Reserved for future extensions.

- base_alpha:

  Unused in the current feature view, kept for interface consistency.

- selected_alpha:

  Unused in the current feature view, kept for interface consistency.

- base_fill:

  Unused in the current feature view, kept for interface consistency.

- base_color:

  Unused in the current feature view, kept for interface consistency.

- selected_color:

  Border colour for filled feature polygons.

- draw_borders:

  Logical. If `FALSE`, borders are not drawn.

- show_base:

  Unused in the current feature view, kept for interface consistency.

- fill_na:

  Fill colour for missing values.

- use_viridis:

  Logical. If `TRUE` and the viridis package is available, use a
  continuous viridis scale.

## Value

Invisibly returns a `ggplot` object.

## Details

For each planning unit \\i\\ and feature \\f\\, the plotted quantities
are: \$\$ \mathrm{baseline}\_{if}, \$\$ \$\$ \mathrm{benefit}\_{if},
\$\$ \$\$ \mathrm{final}\_{if} = \mathrm{baseline}\_{if} +
\mathrm{benefit}\_{if}. \$\$

In the current implementation:

- `baseline` is the summed baseline amount from
  `x$problem$data$dist_features`,

- `benefit` is the summed positive effect from selected actions,

- `final` is `baseline + benefit`.

Negative effects are not subtracted in this plotting method. Therefore,
`value = "final"` should be interpreted as baseline plus selected
positive effects under the current plotting logic.

If `layout = "facet"` and only one run is plotted, one panel is drawn
per feature.

If multiple runs are plotted, exactly one feature must be requested, and
faceting is done by run.

Planning-unit geometry must be available in `x$problem$data$pu_sf`.

          pu = ids,
          action = "conservation",
          selected = 1L
        )
      )
    ),
    class = "Solution"

  plot_spatial_features(sol, features = "feature_1", value = "final")
