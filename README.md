`multiscape` is an exact optimisation framework for multi-objective
spatial planning in R. It is designed for planning problems in which
spatial data, ecological or socioeconomic features, constraints, and
multiple competing objectives must be considered simultaneously within a
single decision-support workflow. The package is built around
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, allowing users to
represent spatial planning problems explicitly as optimisation models
and solve them with exact methods. This makes `multiscape` especially
suitable for applications where transparent model structure,
reproducibility, and rigorous trade-off analysis are important.
`multiscape` supports both general spatial planning formulations and
action-based formulations in which decisions are expressed as
**management actions** applied across planning units. With it, users can
build planning problems from tabular or spatial inputs, define feasible
actions and their effects, add targets and other constraints, register
multiple objectives such as cost, benefit, profit, or fragmentation, and
explore exact trade-offs using multi-objective methods such as
weighted-sum, epsilon-constraint, and AUGMECON. Each retained solution
preserves the correspondence between its objective values and spatial
decisions, allowing alternatives to be analysed in objective space
(`frontier_*()`), decision space (`selection_*()`), and jointly through
objective–decision linkage (`linkage_*()`).

## Installation

Install the stable version from [Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/):

``` r
install.packages("multiscape")
```

Or install the lastest development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/josesalgr/multiscape):

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("josesalgr/multiscape")
```

## Getting started

### The planning problem

The following example represents a stylised **multi-objective multi-use
spatial planning problem**. The landscape is divided into 64 planning
units and contains two ecological features: woodland and riparian
habitat. Each planning unit can remain unmanaged or be assigned to one
of two mutually exclusive management actions: **protection** or
**restoration**.

For every planning unit $i$ and action $a$, the model defines a binary
decision variable $x_{ia}$. The variable equals 1 when action $a$ is
assigned to planning unit $i$, and 0 otherwise. Because the actions are
mutually exclusive, at most one action can be selected in each planning
unit. A planning unit may also remain without intervention.

The analysis asks:

> How does the spatial allocation of protection and restoration change
> as progressively larger implementation budgets become available, and
> how much additional ecological benefit can be obtained?

For each planning unit, `amount` is a synthetic **relative feature
amount**. Baseline values range from 0 to 1: a value of 0 represents no
local amount of the feature, whereas 1 is the largest baseline amount
represented in the simulated landscape. Intermediate values are
continuous relative amounts, not probabilities of occurrence or binary
presence–absence observations. Woodland forms a north-western hotspot,
whereas riparian habitat follows a diagonal corridor.

The 0–1 scale applies to the baseline values only. Because these are
relative indices rather than probabilities or proportions,
action-induced final amounts may exceed 1. For example, doubling a
baseline amount of 0.6 produces a final relative amount of 1.2.

All inputs are included with `multiscape`:

``` r
# load packages
library(multiscape)
library(dplyr)

# Load a complete simulated planning problem.
example_data <- load_sim_multiaction()
```

The object contains the following linked tables:

- `planning_units`: planning-unit identifiers, geometries, and baseline
  costs;
- `features`: identifiers and names of the ecological features;
- `dist_features`: baseline feature amounts by planning unit;
- `actions`: the available management actions;
- `action_costs`: the cost of each feasible planning-unit–action
  combination;
- `effects`: the expected effect of each action on each feature; and
- `effect_assumptions`: the coefficients used to generate the simulated
  effects.

The simulated baseline feature amounts are shown below.

<img src="man/figures/README-example-features-1.png" alt="" width="100%" />

### Stage 1: Create the base problem

[`create_problem()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/create_problem.html)
establishes the spatial domain and the ecological features being
planned. Here, `planning_units` contains the 64 geometries, `features`
defines the feature catalogue, and `dist_features` links every planning
unit to its woodland and riparian amounts. The planning-unit `cost`
column is retained in the problem, although the objective used below
includes only action-specific implementation costs.

``` r
# Initialise the problem using planning-unit geometries and baseline feature
# amounts.
problem <- create_problem(
  pu = example_data$planning_units,
  features = example_data$features,
  dist_features = example_data$dist_features,
  cost = "cost"
)
```

### Stage 2: Define actions and their effects

[`add_actions()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_actions.html)
registers protection and restoration as alternative management uses,
associates each action with its local implementation cost, and defines
the feasible planning-unit–action combinations. Both actions are
available throughout this landscape. The model permits at most one
selected action per planning unit, while leaving a unit unmanaged
remains feasible.

Effects describe how an ecological feature changes when an action is
selected.
[`add_effects()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_effects.html)
supports two interpretations:

- with `effect_type = "after"`, the input specifies the expected **final
  feature amount** under the action;
- with `effect_type = "delta"`, the input specifies the signed **change
  from the baseline**.

With the delta interpretation, positive values represent gains, negative
values represent losses, and zero indicates no change. If $b_{if}$ is
the baseline amount of feature $f$ in planning unit $i$, the final
amount after selecting action $a$ is

$$\text{final amount}_{iaf} = b_{if} + \Delta_{iaf},$$

where $\Delta_{iaf}$ is the value supplied in the `delta` column. The
choice between `after` and `delta` therefore depends on how ecological
responses were estimated, not on the optimisation method.

This example uses explicit delta values. Protection is assumed to
increase woodland and riparian amounts by 100% and 30% of their
respective local baselines, whereas restoration increases them by 25%
and 130%. These percentages are used only to generate the simulated
data. The table passed to `add_effects()` already contains the resulting
absolute change for every planning-unit–action–feature combination. For
example, a woodland baseline of 0.6 combined with a 100% relative
increase produces `delta = 0.6` and a final relative amount of 1.2. The
coefficient representing the relative increase must therefore not be
confused with either the delta value or the final feature amount.

``` r
# Inspect the assumptions used to generate their
# ecological effects, and the first planning-unit--action--feature records.
example_data$effect_assumptions
#>    action feature relative_change
#> 1 protect       1            1.00
#> 2 protect       2            0.30
#> 3 restore       1            0.25
#> 4 restore       2            1.30

head(example_data$effects)
#>   pu  action feature        delta
#> 1  1 protect       1 0.0016615573
#> 2  1 protect       2 0.0934209672
#> 3  1 restore       1 0.0004153893
#> 4  1 restore       2 0.4048241911
#> 5  2 protect       1 0.0024787522
#> 6  2 protect       2 0.0132913814

problem <- problem |>
  add_actions(
    actions = example_data$actions,
    cost = example_data$action_costs
  ) |>
  add_effects(
    effects = example_data$effects,
    effect_type = "delta"
  )
```

### Stage 3: Define the constraints

[`add_constraint_targets_relative()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_constraint_targets_relative.html)
requires the selected actions to generate gains equivalent to at least
10% of the total baseline amount of **each feature separately**. Targets
restrict the feasible set; they are not additional objectives. Other
applications could introduce budgets, area requirements, locked
decisions, or spatial constraints at this stage.

``` r
# Require action-induced gains of at least 10% of the total baseline amount of
# woodland and at least 10% of the total baseline amount of riparian habitat.
problem <- problem |>
  add_constraint_targets_relative(0.10)
```

### Stage 4: Define the objectives

Objectives are registered independently so they can later be combined
using different multi-objective methods.
[`add_objective_min_cost()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_objective_min_cost.html)
minimises the total implementation cost of the selected actions.
Planning-unit costs are excluded because the example defines economic
expenditure through the action-specific cost table.
[`add_objective_max_benefit()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_objective_max_benefit.html)
maximises total ecological benefit, calculated as the sum of
action-induced gains across selected planning units and features.

Because woodland and riparian effects use the same relative scale and no
feature-specific weights are supplied, the example gives both features
equal weight in the benefit objective. See the
[`add_objective_max_benefit()`
reference](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/add_objective_max_benefit.html)
for the complete definition of the objective, its available arguments,
and how feature contributions are aggregated.

``` r
problem <- problem |>
  # Minimise action-specific implementation costs. Planning-unit costs are
  # excluded because expenditure is represented by the action-cost table.
  add_objective_min_cost(
    alias = "cost",
    include_pu_cost = FALSE,
    include_action_cost = TRUE
  ) |>
  # Maximise the sum of action-induced ecological gains across both features.
  add_objective_max_benefit(alias = "benefit")
```

The summary confirms that the spatial inputs, actions, effects,
constraints, and two objectives are present. It also shows that the
multi-objective method and solver have not yet been selected.

``` r

# and optimisation solver.

```

### Configure the multi-objective method

The registered objectives define what the plans should achieve; the
multi-objective method determines how the trade-off between them is
explored. Here,
[`set_method_epsilon_constraint()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_method_epsilon_constraint.html)
treats ecological benefit as the primary objective and evaluates six
increasingly permissive limits on total cost. For each cost limit, the
model identifies the feasible plan with the greatest ecological benefit.

With `lexicographic = TRUE`, solutions tied on the primary benefit
objective are refined by minimising cost. This prevents the method from
returning an unnecessarily expensive plan when a less costly plan
attains the same benefit. The six limits are generated by
[`set_runs_grid()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_runs_grid.html).
The example uses Gurobi through
[`set_solver_gurobi()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_solver_gurobi.html),
which requires the Gurobi R package and a valid licence.

``` r
problem <- problem |>
  # Maximise benefit under six alternative limits on total cost.
  # Lexicographic refinement selects the least-cost plan among solutions tied
  # on the primary objective.
  set_method_epsilon_constraint(
    primary = "benefit",
    runs = set_runs_grid(6),
    lexicographic = TRUE
  ) |>
  set_solver_gurobi(gap_limit = 0)
```

### Solve the problem

[`solve()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solve.html)
returns a `SolutionSet` containing the solver status, objective values,
selected action assignments, and run-level information for every
epsilon-constraint problem.
[`get_objectives()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_objectives.html)
extracts the resulting objective values, with one row per stored
solution and one column per objective.

``` r
solutions <- solve(problem)
get_objectives(solutions, format = "wide")
#>   solution_id   benefit   cost
#> 1           1  1.185508   2.60
#> 2           2 15.359707  22.25
#> 3           3 24.535156  41.91
#> 4           4 29.006289  61.41
#> 5           5 29.782291  81.46
#> 6           6 29.796218 101.28
```

### Link run configurations to stored solutions

A multi-objective method evaluates a sequence of optimisation
configurations.
[`get_runs()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/get_runs.html)
returns the registry of these configurations together with their solver
outcomes and, when available, the identifier of the solution they
produced.

``` r
runs <- get_runs(solutions)
runs
#>   run_id solution_id  status     runtime gap
#> 1      1           1 optimal 0.005000114   0
#> 2      2           2 optimal 0.003999949   0
#> 3      3           3 optimal 0.008000135   0
#> 4      4           4 optimal 0.003000021   0
#> 5      5           5 optimal 0.005000114   0
#> 6      6           6 optimal 0.002000093   0
```

Each row records one attempted run configuration. `run_id` identifies
the configuration, including its epsilon limit and solver outcome. A run
is not itself a solution: an infeasible configuration, a run that
terminates without a feasible solution, or a run affected by a solver
error may have no associated `solution_id`. When a run does produce a
solution that is retained in the `SolutionSet`, `solution_id` identifies
that stored solution for subsequent extraction, comparison, and mapping.
In this example, all configured runs produce stored solutions.

The treatment of infeasible runs, runs without a solution, and
unexpected errors can be controlled with
[`set_runs_control()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_runs_control.html).
Depending on these settings, solving can stop when a failed
configuration is encountered or retain the failed run in the run history
without an associated solution.

This distinction is important when reading the figures below. With
`label_runs = TRUE`, `plot_tradeoff()` labels points using `run_id`,
whereas functions that extract or map stored plans generally use
`solution_id`. `get_runs()` provides the link between the run
configurations and the solutions that were successfully stored.

## Interpret the solutions

### Objective space: performance and trade-offs

Each point below represents a stored spatial solution generated by one
epsilon-constraint run. The plot is produced with
[`plot_tradeoff()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/plot_tradeoff.html).
With lexicographic refinement, the returned plans are intended to lie on
the **observed efficient frontier**. This is the frontier represented by
the six runs evaluated here, not necessarily every attainable trade-off
in the complete discrete solution space.

The horizontal axis shows the cost actually incurred by each solution,
which may be lower than the upper cost limit imposed in its run. The
vertical axis shows total ecological benefit, obtained by summing the
action-induced gains across both features and all selected planning
units. Moving from left to right therefore reveals how the maximum
observed ecological benefit changes as more expensive plans become
available.

``` r
plot_tradeoff(
  solutions,
  objectives = c("cost", "benefit"),
  connect = TRUE,
  label_runs = TRUE
) +
  ggplot2::labs(
    x = "Total implementation cost (cost units)",
    y = "Total ecological gain (relative-amount units)"
  )
```

<img src="man/figures/README-example-tradeoff-1.png" alt="" width="100%" />

The curve rises rapidly at first and becomes flatter near its
high-benefit end. In this region, substantial increases in
implementation cost produce only small additional ecological gains. The
result illustrates declining marginal returns and helps identify where
further expenditure has comparatively little effect.

### Identify a compromise solution

A multi-objective analysis should consider both **objective space**,
which describes how well each plan performs, and **decision space**,
which describes where actions are allocated.
[`frontier_knee()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_knee.html)
identifies an empirical compromise on the observed frontier: a solution
near the point where additional ecological gains begin to require
comparatively large increases in cost.

``` r
knee <- frontier_knee(
  solutions,
  objectives = c("cost", "benefit")
)
knee |> dplyr::select(solution_id, cost, benefit, knee_score, method)
#>   solution_id  cost  benefit knee_score   method
#> 1           3 41.91 24.53516   0.295399 distance
```

The knee is a decision aid rather than a universally optimal answer. Its
location depends on the solutions included in the observed frontier, the
normalisation of the objectives, and the geometric criterion used to
calculate the knee score. It should therefore be interpreted alongside
policy preferences and the spatial characteristics of the selected plan.

[`frontier_extremes()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_extremes.html)
and
[`frontier_distances()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_distances.html)
provide complementary views of the observed objective space. They
identify the objective-wise extremes and calculate each solution’s
normalised distance from the observed ideal and nadir points.

``` r
frontier_extremes(
  solutions,
  objectives = c("cost", "benefit"),
  ties = "first"
)
#>   solution_id objective sense bound  role      value
#> 1           1      cost   min   min  best   2.600000
#> 2           6      cost   min   max worst 101.280000
#> 3           1   benefit   max   min worst   1.185508
#> 4           6   benefit   max   max  best  29.796218

frontier_distances(
  solutions,
  objectives = c("cost", "benefit")
)
#>   solution_id   cost   benefit norm_cost norm_benefit distance_to_ideal
#> 1           1   2.60  1.185508 0.0000000 1.0000000000         1.0000000

#> 6             5
```

### Decision space: spatial prescriptions

Plans that are close in objective space can still prescribe different
actions in different locations.
[`plot_spatial_actions()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/plot_spatial_actions.html)
complements the trade-off plot by showing how protection and restoration
are reallocated as the cost limit is relaxed. Planning units shown only
through the base layer receive no management action in the corresponding
solution. In the call below, `solutions = 1:6` selects **solution IDs**,
not run IDs; the preceding run registry provides the link between the
two identifiers.

``` r
plot_spatial_actions(
  solutions,
  solutions = 1:6,
  fill_values = c(
    protect = "#2E7D32",
    restore = "#E69F00"
  ),
  base_alpha = 0.12
)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-example-maps-1.png" alt="" width="100%" />

The sequence of maps should be interpreted together with the baseline
feature patterns. Protection and restoration may expand into new
planning units as larger budgets become available, but actions can also
be substituted or relocated when a different spatial combination
produces greater benefit under the active cost limit.

### Compare spatial similarity

Similar objective values do not necessarily imply similar spatial
prescriptions.
[`selection_similarity()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/selection_similarity.html)
compares the sets of selected planning-unit–action pairs for every pair
of solutions. Jaccard similarity is useful here because it focuses on
jointly selected assignments and does not inflate similarity through
planning units that remain unmanaged in both plans.

A value of 1 indicates identical sets of selected assignments, whereas 0
indicates that the two solutions share no selected planning-unit–action
pair. Rows and columns correspond to solution identifiers, and the
diagonal is always 1 because every solution is identical to itself.

``` r
selection_similarity(
  solutions,
  metric = "jaccard",
  format = "matrix"
)
#>            1         2          3          4          5          6

#> attr(,"metric")
#> [1] "jaccard"
```

### Identify recurrent action assignments

[`selection_frequency()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/selection_frequency.html)
calculates how often each planning-unit–action pair is selected across
the solution set. In this example, frequency is the proportion of the
six solutions containing a particular assignment. High frequency
indicates recurrence across the explored trade-offs, but it should not,
on its own, be interpreted as ecological irreplaceability.

``` r
action_frequency <- selection_frequency(solutions)
head(
  action_frequency[order(-action_frequency$frequency), ],
  10
)
#>    pu  action n_selected n_solutions frequency
#> 20 18 restore          5           6 0.8333333

### Link objective performance to spatial change

Objective-space proximity does not necessarily imply similar spatial
prescriptions.
[`frontier_neighbors()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/frontier_neighbors.html)
identifies local neighbours along the observed objective-space
trade-off. Here, solutions are oriented towards increasing ecological
benefit, matching the progression from lower- to higher-budget plans
used above.
[`linkage_distances()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_distances.html)
then compares those same solution pairs in objective and decision space.

``` r
neighbors <- frontier_neighbors(
  solutions,
  objectives = c("benefit", "cost")
)

linkage <- linkage_distances(
  solutions,
  objectives = c("cost", "benefit"),
  pairs = neighbors,
  decision_metric = "jaccard"
)

linkage |>
  dplyr::select(
    from_solution,
    to_solution,
    objective_distance,
    decision_distance,
    changed_planning_units
  )
#>   from_solution to_solution objective_distance decision_distance
#> 1             1           2          0.5339373         1.0000000
#> 2             2           3          0.3775459         0.4642857
#> 3             3           4          0.2519343         0.3000000
#> 4             4           5          0.2049843         0.2307692
#> 5             5           6          0.2008518         0.2153846
#>   changed_planning_units
#> 1                     16
#> 2                     13
#> 3                     12
#> 4                     12
#> 5                     13
```

The two distances describe different aspects of the same comparison:
`objective_distance` measures separation in normalised objective space,
whereas `decision_distance` measures dissimilarity between spatial
action allocations. Keeping them separate makes it possible to identify
similar levels of performance that require substantially different
spatial plans.

[`linkage_transition()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_transition.html)
provides a more detailed view of a selected comparison. Here, we examine
the transition from solution 3 to solution 4.

``` r
transition <- linkage_transition(
  solutions,
  from = 3,
  to = 4,
  objectives = c("cost", "benefit")
)

transition
#> Objective--decision transition
#> From solution: 3 
#> To solution:   4 
#> 
#> Objective distance: 0.2519 
#> Decision distance:  0.3 
#> 
#> Planning units changed: 12 of 64 (18.8%)
#> Activated:            12 
#> Deactivated:          0 
#> Action switches:      0 
#> Composition changes:  0 
#> 
#> Objective changes:
#> - cost: 19.5 (improvement -19.5)
#> - benefit: 4.47113 (improvement 4.47113)
#> 
#> Use `$summary`, `$objectives`, `$transitions`, `$actions`, or `$state_matrix` for details.
```

The printed summary reports objective and decision distances, the number
of planning units whose state changes, and the corresponding changes in
each objective. Detailed planning-unit, action, and state-transition
tables remain available within the returned object.

[`linkage_turnover()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_turnover.html)
extends these local comparisons by relating decision-space turnover to
the associated objective-space change. Its `reconfiguration_rate`
highlights local transitions that require comparatively large spatial
changes for a given separation in objective performance.

``` r
turnover <- linkage_turnover(
  solutions,
  objectives = c("cost", "benefit"),
  pairs = neighbors,
  decision_metric = "jaccard"
)

turnover |>
  dplyr::select(
    from_solution,
    to_solution,
    objective_distance,
    decision_distance,
    reconfiguration_rate
  )
#>   from_solution to_solution objective_distance decision_distance
#> 1             1           2          0.5339373         1.0000000
#> 2             2           3          0.3775459         0.4642857
#> 3             3           4          0.2519343         0.3000000
#> 4             4           5          0.2049843         0.2307692
#> 5             5           6          0.2008518         0.2153846
#>   reconfiguration_rate
#> 1             1.872879
#> 2             1.229747
#> 3             1.190786
#> 4             1.125790
#> 5             1.072356
```

Informative pairs can then be selected reproducibly with
[`linkage_contrasts()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/linkage_contrasts.html).
For example, the contrasts below identify the local transitions with the
largest spatial reconfiguration relative to objective-space change.

``` r
linkage_contrasts(
  turnover,
  type = "high_reconfiguration",
  n = 2
) |>
  dplyr::select(
    contrast_rank,
    contrast_type,
    from_solution,
    to_solution,
    objective_distance,
    decision_distance,
    reconfiguration_rate
  )
#>   contrast_rank        contrast_type from_solution to_solution
#> 1             1 high_reconfiguration             1           2
#> 2             2 high_reconfiguration             2           3
#>   objective_distance decision_distance reconfiguration_rate
#> 1          0.5339373         1.0000000             1.872879
#> 2          0.3775459         0.4642857             1.229747
```

`selection_consistency()` provides a complementary decision-space
summary of which planning-unit states recur or vary across the
alternatives considered.

## What can `multiscape` do?

A planning problem can combine:

- planning units and spatially distributed features;
- alternative actions and action-specific effects;
- targets, budgets, area requirements, and locked decisions;
- boundary, adjacency, distance, and other spatial relations;
- objectives for cost, benefit, loss, profit, impact, and fragmentation;
- post-optimisation analysis in objective space, decision space, and
  their objective–decision linkage; and
- commercial or open-source optimisation solvers.

Objectives are registered independently from the method used to combine
them. `multiscape` currently implements:

- **weighted sum** for preference-based combinations of objectives;
- **epsilon-constraint** for policy or performance thresholds; and
- **AUGMECON**, the augmented epsilon-constraint method, for systematic
  generation of efficient alternatives.
